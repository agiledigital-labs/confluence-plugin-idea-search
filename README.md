# Confluence Plugin Idea Search

Provides a blue print for idea capture, search, and display.

# Release

The latest released version [can be downloaded from github.](https://github.com/agiledigital-labs/confluence-plugin-idea-search/releases/latest) 

# Requirements

The plugin is built using the Atlassian SDK, for installation instructions see [Atlassian documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/set-up-the-atlassian-plugin-sdk-and-build-a-project/).

# Adding to confluence

Either add the addon throught he Atlassian Market place (link to come) or by directly installing the .jar file from [one of the releases](https://github.com/agiledigital-labs/confluence-plugin-idea-search/releases)

# Developing

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the [Atlassian SDK](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/)
3. In the root directory run `atlas-run` to start the confluence server
4. Once Confluence has started you can access it via http://localhost:1990/confluence. Note you will need to change the baseUrl in the confluence settings otherwise you will have issues with the creation of resources

- To run without tests add this argument to the command `-Dmaven.test.skip=true`
- We suggest dumping logs to a file due to the large number of lines in the output. A command to do this would be `rm -rf logs.log; atlas-run > logs.log`

To run the hot reload, have the confluence server running. Run the command `atlas-mvn package` which will build the app. The server will see the change and hot load the new version into the app.
